✓ FIXED: Updated move_cursor address to 0x02023FFC for FireRed v1.1
  - The use_attack function now correctly reads cursor position from memory
  - navigate_to_move() handles navigation from any starting position

✓ FIXED: Current pokemon returns wrong pokemon
  - Added active_party_slot address (0x002023BCE)
  - get_current_pokemon_state() now uses get_active_party_slot()
  - capture_battle_state() now uses get_active_party_slot()

✓ FIXED: Switch pokemon menu navigation
  - Added pokemon_menu_cursor address (0x00203B0A9)
  - execute_switch() now reads menu order from get_full_party()
  - Navigates using cursor position read from memory with UP/DOWN navigation
  - Works regardless of previous switches during battle
  - Validates against switching to already active Pokemon
  - Documentation updated to clarify that get_team_state() returns context-dependent ordering

✓ FIXED: Switch function menu ordering bug
  - execute_switch() now reads party BEFORE opening menu (default slot order)
  - Identifies target Pokemon by slot and saves entire Pokemon object
  - Opens switch menu, then reads party AGAIN (now in menu display order)
  - Matches target Pokemon by comparing all fields (species_id, level, current_hp, max_hp)
  - Correctly handles duplicate species and menu reordering after previous switches

✓ FIXED: Implemented press_buttons MCP function
  - Added press_buttons() tool for submitting button sequences
  - Validates button names (A, B, Start, Select, L, R, Up, Down, Left, Right)
  - Configurable delay_ms parameter between button presses (default: 100ms)
  - Documentation instructs Claude to take screenshots before/after for verification
  - Returns structured response with success status, buttons pressed, and timing info

✓ FIXED: Screenshot functionality using FastMCP Image class
  - Updated get_screenshot() to return FastMCP Image object
  - Converts PIL Image to PNG bytes before passing to Image class
  - Properly follows MCP protocol for image data transmission
  - Claude can now correctly view and interpret screenshots

Implement a simplified get_party that doesn't return so much information for when it is not needed.

Switch function is implemented by Claude providing a slot number, MCP reads pokemon in battle menu and identifies which pokemon Claude wants to switch to, MCP opens pokemon switch menu, then identifies the slot of the pokemon that Claude wanted to switch to and executes the switch. This is to circumvent the get_team function giving a different order while in the battle menu and the pokemon switch menu, but causes a lot of unessary calls to the mgba-http API and might be improved in the future. Possibly rely only on pokemon name (accepting that duplicate pokemon will cause errors) to have Claude call switch function with name instead of slot.

Write project instructions, to make it clear what the goals of the project are to Claude (either as project instructions or as part of MCP)

Potentially do not expose delay in the press_buttons function to lessen the burden on Claude

Player/pokemon status doesn't seem to work correctly. This is also affects downstream functions like attack, which check for change in status.
