FIXED: Current pokemon returns wrong pokemon

Fix switch pokemon.

Get team executes correctly when in the main battle screen. But when in the switch pokemon screen, it returns the pokemon with the order shown on the screen (that is the currently active pokemon is in position 1). I need to:
a) differentiate between the two, so that it's clear that the active pokemon returned by get_team refers only to the default ordering and not the ordering shown on the pokemon switching menu). 
b) Improve pokemon switcher so it calls get team, identifies the current order and selects the correct pokemon to switch to.
c) verify that it works even when a pokemon has fainted.
