✓ FIXED: Updated move_cursor address to 0x02023FFC for FireRed v1.1
  - The use_attack function now correctly reads cursor position from memory
  - navigate_to_move() handles navigation from any starting position

✓ FIXED: Current pokemon returns wrong pokemon
  - Added active_party_slot address (0x002023BCE)
  - get_current_pokemon_state() now uses get_active_party_slot()
  - capture_battle_state() now uses get_active_party_slot()

✓ FIXED: Switch pokemon menu navigation
  - Added pokemon_menu_cursor address (0x00203B0A9)
  - execute_switch() now reads menu order from get_full_party()
  - Navigates using cursor position read from memory with UP/DOWN navigation
  - Works regardless of previous switches during battle
  - Validates against switching to already active Pokemon
  - Documentation updated to clarify that get_team_state() returns context-dependent ordering

Implement a simplified get_party that doesn't return so much information for when it is not needed.
